        We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise. Data
        protection is of a particularly high priority for the management of the
        Agentur Baumeister. The use of the Internet pages of the Agentur
        Baumeister is possible without any indication of personal data; however,
        if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our
        website, processing of personal data could become necessary. If the
        processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis
        for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail
        address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line
        with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with
        the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the Agentur
        Baumeister. By means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise
        would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose
        of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data
        subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of
        the rights to which they are entitled.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the controller, the Agentur Baumeister has implemented numerous
        technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete
        protection of personal data processed through this website. However,
        Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so
        absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data
        subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means,
        e.g. by telephone.

      3. Collection of general data and information
      The website of the Agentur Baumeister collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the website. This general data and information are stored in the server log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.<br>
      When using these general data and information, the Agentur Baumeister does not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, the Agentur Baumeister analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.

      If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the European legislator or another competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in accordance with legal requirements.

      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-8">
        <li>The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data.</li>

      <p class="">
        Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her, or similarly significantly affects him or her, as long as the decision (1) is not is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) is not authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, or (3) is not based on the data subject's explicit consent.
      </p>
      <p class="">
        If the decision (1) is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) it is based on the data subject's explicit consent, the Agentur Baumeister shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and contest the decision.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the data subject wishes to exercise the rights concerning automated individual decision-making, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the Agentur Baumeister.
